#### Please add your answers to the ***Analysis of  Algorithms*** exercises here.

## Exercise I

a) O(n) - for every single digit increase in n, the while loop runs one more time. This means there is a linear relationship between time complexity and n.

b)


c) O(n) - Simple recursion. For each addition of a bunny, the function recurses a proportionate amount of times until it reaches the base case.

## Exercise II

I would use a binary search algorithm to find floor f.

Start at the floor mid way between the lowest and highest, and drop an egg. If it breaks, then I can eliminate any higher floors. If it doesn't, then I can eliminate the lower floors. I would keep splitting the remaining possible floors in half and repeating these steps until I have one remaining option.
